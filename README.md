# Data1030 Final Project - Loan Default Probability Predictor

Final Project for DATA1030 at Brown University.

The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model to predict the probability that a loan will default.

## Data Source

[Lending Clubâ€™s loan data from 2007-2017 adopted from Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/mlfinancebook/lending-club-loans-data) 

Due to limit in the github for the file size, the compiled full dataset cannot be uploaded, but can be accessed via the above link. Alternatively, 20 splited data files of the data has been uploaded to the data folder under 'raw data in multiple files'. All the subsequent results in the jupyter notebook are performed using the actual data (~1.1GB). You should load the full data in case you want to reproduce the results.

You can also find description of each features in data/feature_description.xlsx in this repo.
