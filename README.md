# data1030-final

Final Project for DATA1030 at Brown University.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the probability that a loan will default.

Lending Clubâ€™s loan data from 2007-2017 adopted from Kaggle. Due to limit in the github for the file size, a sample of the data has been uploaded to the 'data' folder in the repository. However, all the subsequent results in the jupyter notebook is with actual data (~1GB) under https://www.kaggle.com/mlfinancebook/lending-club-loans-data. You should load the full data in case you want to reproduce the results.

You can also find description of each features in data/feature_description.xlsx in this repo.
